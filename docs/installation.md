# Installation

If you'd like to install into an existing environment we recommend installing
coincident directly from GitHub:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/uw-cryo/coincident.git@main
```

Alternatively, you can install a fresh locked environment with
[pixi.sh](https://pixi.sh/latest/):

```bash
gh repo clone uw-cryo/coincident
cd coincident
pixi install
pixi shell
```
